# CodeCat Online Judge

This is a full-stack Online Judge for students' code submission, which gives a verdict based on code correctness. This project involves a good amount of frontend and backend knowledge to complete, so I realized this is something I could build to put my skills to good practice.

### Live Link:  [CodeCat OJ](https://ojcat.xyz)

## Requirements

* NodeJS (version 20.14.0)
* Visual Studio Code (latest version is preferred)
* Git (latest version is preferred)
* npm (version 10.8.1)

## Installation and Usage
Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install subsequent modules and frameworks.

### Open the cloned repository in VS code and follow these steps in order:

* Open two separate terminals and make sure you are in the root folder of this project
* Go to the backend folder in one terminal and to the frontend in another
* Run the following command in both terminals:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

* #### Now you can access the app at this URL: [http://localhost:1099](http://localhost:1099)
